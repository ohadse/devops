# File input plugin
Documentation: https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-inputs-file.html
You will learn how to read files from logstash.

Start with 1.conf and proceed with the excercises under in the given order.
If you need help, you can take a peek at 1.fasit.conf or ask the speakers. 
Try to run logstash at each completed step to make sure you are on the right track. 
Remember to delete the file at sincedb_path between runs, so that logstash process the whole input file again. 

We assume you hava a shell in the same directory as this file.

1. Fix 1.conf and run logstash with --configtest parameter. Verify the configuration is OK.
> ..\..\..\logstash-2.1.1\bin\logstash agent -f 1.conf --configtest
$ ../../../logstash-2.1.1/bin/logstash agent -f 1.conf --configtest

2. Run 1.conf job in logstash. Verify that all lines from the csv file appear in your console.
> ..\..\..\logstash-2.1.1\bin\logstash agent -f 1.conf
$ ../../../logstash-2.1.1/bin/logstash agent -f 1.conf 

3. Notice the sincedb_path file in your directory. 
	This file keeps a pointer to the location that logstash has proccessed the file so far. 
	If you don't delete it, logstash will not read the file from start but from that pointer.

4. Delete this file every time you want logstash to process the file from start. You will need to do this for the next excercises.
